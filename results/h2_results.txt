DATA SUMMARY:
  Total conditions: 251 
  Potentially avoidable: 100 (preventable: 67 , treatable: 33 )
  Non-avoidable: 151 

DEVIATION FROM PRE-REGISTRATION:
  CVs use ASRs where ABS published them (n_states = 8),
  crude rates where ASRs were suppressed for small jurisdictions.
  Rate type recorded per condition in rate_type column.

  p-value: 0.87162 
  Rank-biserial r: 0.012 
  Median CV avoidable: 30.8 %
  Median CV non-avoidable: 31.1 %

H2a SUPPLEMENTARY: Permutation test
  Observed median difference: -0.3 
  p-value: 0.9056 

H2b SECONDARY: Preventable vs Treatable
  U: 1135 
  p-value: 0.83165
