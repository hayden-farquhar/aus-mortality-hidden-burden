NOTES
============================================================

1. MUR = Multiple cause mentions / Underlying cause deaths.
   A MUR of 5.0 means the condition appears 5x more often as any
   cause of death than as the underlying cause.

2. 'Hidden deaths' = multiple mentions - underlying deaths.
   These represent deaths where the condition contributed but was
   not selected as the underlying cause.

3. Data source: ABS Cube 10, Causes of Death 2023.
4. Conditions with < 10 underlying deaths excluded for stability.
5. Sex ratio > 1 indicates higher relative hidden burden in males.
