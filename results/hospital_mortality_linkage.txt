CORRELATION RESULTS:

1. Procedures per death vs MUR (Spearman):
   rho = 0.510, p = 0.0899

2. Diagnosis seps per death vs MUR (Spearman):
   rho = 0.573, p = 0.0513

3. Raw procedure volume vs MUR (Spearman):
   rho = -0.042, p = 0.8970

4. Underlying deaths vs MUR (Spearman):
   rho = -0.594, p = 0.0415

5. Log(Procs/death) vs Log(MUR) (Pearson):
   r = 0.618, p = 0.0322

INTERPRETATION:

No significant correlation was found between hospital procedure
intensity and MUR. This suggests the hidden burden of mortality
(as measured by MUR) is not systematically related to the level
of hospital procedural activity within a clinical domain.

NOTES:

1. MUR data from ABS Cube 10 (2023, multiple causes of death).
2. Hospital separations from AIHW hospital statistics (2022-23).
3. Analysis is ecological (domain-level), not individual-level.
4. Small n limits statistical power. Results are exploratory.
5. Domains without ACHI procedure codes (Mental health, Infectious
   diseases, Injury/poisoning) are excluded from procedure analyses.
