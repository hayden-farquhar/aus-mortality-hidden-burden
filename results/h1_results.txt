DEVIATION FROM PRE-REGISTRATION:
  Pre-registered test: Paired Wilcoxon across n=17 years (2006-2022)
  Actual test: Paired Wilcoxon across n= 4  hypertension sub-conditions (I10-I13)
  Reason: ABS Cube 10 (multiple causes) contains only single-year
  data (2023). Historical multi-year MUR extraction not possible
  from the 2024 data release.

AGGREGATE RESULT (DESCRIPTIVE):
  Hypertensive diseases (I10-I15) MUR, 2023:
    Male:    11.1
    Female:  8.3
    Ratio:   1.34 (male MUR is 34% higher)
    Driven by Essential hypertension (I10): M=41.8, F=21.2

H1a PRIMARY TEST: Paired Wilcoxon Signed-Rank
  Null: No difference in male vs female MUR for hypertensive diseases
  Test statistic V: 1.826 
  p-value (exact, two-tailed): 0.125 
  Effect size r: 0.767 
  n sub-condition pairs: 4 
  All differences positive (male > female):  TRUE 

H1a SUPPLEMENTARY: Exact Binomial Sign Test
  Positive differences: 4 of 4 
  p-value: 0.125 

H1a SUPPLEMENTARY: Bootstrap 95% CI
  Mean (male MUR - female MUR): 5.488 
  95% BCa CI: 0.238 to 15.709 
  Resamples: 10,000

H1a CONTINGENCY: Permutation Test
  p-value: 0.1236 
  Permutations: 10,000

H1b SECONDARY: Temporal Trend (crude death rates, not MUR)
  Spearman rho: 0.709 
  p-value: 0.0145521 
  n years: 11 
  Direction: Gap widening 
  Note: Uses underlying cause crude death rates from Cube 14,
  not MUR, due to data availability.

NOTE: p-values are UNCORRECTED. Apply Holm-Bonferroni correction
across all confirmatory tests using Script 16 before interpreting
significance.
