DEVIATION FROM PRE-REGISTRATION:
  Pre-registered test: Paired Wilcoxon across n=17 years (2006-2022)
  Actual test: Paired Wilcoxon across n= 8  block-level sub-conditions
  Reason: ABS Cube 10 (multiple causes) contains only single-year
  data (2023). Historical multi-year MUR extraction not possible
  from the 2024 data release.

AGGREGATE RESULT (DESCRIPTIVE):
  Mental & behavioural disorders (F00-F99) MUR, 2023:
    Male:    4.9
    Female:  3.0
    Ratio:   1.62 (male MUR is 62% higher)

H3a PRIMARY: Paired Wilcoxon Signed-Rank
  Null: No difference in male vs female MUR for mental disorders
  Test statistic V: 2.24 
  p-value (exact, two-tailed): 0.0234375 
  Effect size r: 0.801 
  n block-level pairs: 8 
  Positive differences (male > female): 7 of 8 

H3a SUPPLEMENTARY: Exact Binomial Sign Test
  p-value: 0.0703125 

H3a SUPPLEMENTARY: Bootstrap 95% CI
  Mean (male MUR - female MUR): 40.783 
  95% Percentile CI: 7.689 to 82.329 

H3a SUPPLEMENTARY: Permutation Test
  p-value: 0.0253 

H3b SECONDARY: Substance Use (F10-F19)
  n conditions: 5 
  p-value: 0.625 
  Effect size r: 0.219 
  Mean diff: 167.1 

H3b SECONDARY: Non-Substance (F20-F99)
  n conditions: 6 
  p-value: 0.03125 
  Effect size r: 0.879 
  Mean diff: 55.2 

H3c SECONDARY: Temporal Trend (crude death rates, not MUR)
  Spearman rho: 0.627 
  p-value: 0.0388453 
  n years: 11 
  Direction: Gap narrowing 

NOTE: p-values are UNCORRECTED. Apply Holm-Bonferroni correction
across all confirmatory tests using Script 16 before interpreting
significance.
