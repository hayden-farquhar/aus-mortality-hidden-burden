CONFIRMATORY ANALYSIS SUMMARY
Pre-Registered Hypotheses: Holm-Bonferroni Corrected Results
============================================================

Date: 2026-02-05 17:16 
Pre-registration: OSF [insert DOI]
Family-wise alpha = 0.05
Correction method: Holm-Bonferroni (sequential)

================================================================
CORRECTION SCOPE 1: Primary Tests Only (n=3)
================================================================
Per D6: 'supported if primary test achieves p < 0.05 after
Holm-Bonferroni correction.'

  H5a  p_uncorrected = 0.0234375  p_holm = 0.0703125  
  H1a  p_uncorrected = 0.125  p_holm = 0.25  
  H4a  p_uncorrected = 0.87162  p_holm = 0.87162  

  Supported: 0 / 3

HYPOTHESIS VERDICTS
================================================================

H1 (Hypertension hidden burden):
  Primary (H1a): Not supported (p_holm = 0.25 )
  Direction consistent, bootstrap CI excludes zero, but n=4 limits power.

H4 (Geographic variation x preventability):
  Primary (H4a): Not supported (p_holm = 0.8716 )
  Clear null finding. Median CVs nearly identical.

H5 (Mental health hidden burden):
  Primary (H5a): Not supported (p_holm = 0.07031 )
  Strong uncorrected effect (p=0.023, r=0.80); 7/8 blocks male > female.
  Marginal after correction -- warrants replication with multi-year data.
  H5b reversal: sex gap driven by NON-SUBSTANCE disorders, not substance use.

NOTES
================================================================

1. Secondary tests are conditional on their primary test being
   significant. If primary fails, secondary is not formally
   interpreted, but descriptive patterns are reported.

2. Pre-registered design assumed n=17 year-level MUR pairs.
   Actual data: single-year cross-sectional MUR (Cube 10, 2023).
   Adapted to use sub-conditions as paired observations.
   Reduced sample sizes limit statistical power.

3. Temporal analyses (H1b, H5c) use crude death rates from
   Cube 14 (underlying cause), not MUR.

4. Exploratory analyses (E1-E7, E-HM1-E-HM4) are reported
   separately without correction, clearly labelled.

5. All results reported regardless of significance, per
   pre-registration commitment to full transparency.
